# Snake Game 🐍

A fun, interactive **Snake Game** built using **Java Swing**! The game challenges players to control a snake, collect food, and avoid walls while growing longer.

## 🚀 Features
- **Classic Snake Mechanics**: Move the snake, eat food, and grow!
- **Keyboard Controls**: Navigate using arrow keys.
- **Random Food Placement**: New food appears when consumed.
- **Game Over Mechanism**: If the snake collides with a wall, the game ends.
- **Smooth Animations**: The game loop updates movement every `200ms`.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys **(Up, Down, Left, Right)** to move.
2. Eat food to grow longer.
3. Avoid hitting the walls—colliding **ends the game**.
4. Try to achieve the longest snake possible!
